# Sentry Mode Contact Alert Flow

## Overview

Sentry Mode creates a comprehensive emergency notification system that automatically alerts trusted contacts when threats are detected. This document explains the complete flow from threat detection to contact response.

## Contact Alert Flow

### 1. Threat Detection & Alert Triggering

**When a threat is detected:**
- ThreatSense analyzes incoming messages/texts
- If threat level meets or exceeds user's threshold, Sentry Mode activates
- System automatically sends notifications to trusted contact through multiple channels

**Alert Channels:**
- **SMS Text Message** (Primary)
- **Email Notification** (Secondary)
- **Push Notification** (If contact has ThreatSense app)

### 2. What the Trusted Contact Receives

#### SMS Message Content:
```
ðŸš¨ THREAT ALERT ðŸš¨

[Contact Name], your trusted contact has been notified of a [Threat Level] level threat.

Threat: [Threat Type]
Details: [Description]
Time: [Timestamp]
Location: [GPS Location if available]

Please check on them immediately.

Reply with:
- "OK" to acknowledge
- "CALL" to call them
- "TEXT" to send a message
- "IGNORE" if this is a false alarm

Stay safe!
```

#### Email Content:
- Professional email with detailed threat information
- Clear instructions on immediate actions
- Response options and emergency procedures
- Contact information for support

### 3. Contact Response Options

The trusted contact can respond in several ways:

#### A. Acknowledgment Response
- **Action**: Reply "OK" to SMS or email
- **Result**: Main user receives confirmation that contact is aware
- **Timeline**: Expected within 5 minutes

#### B. Direct Contact Response
- **Action**: Reply "CALL" or "TEXT"
- **Result**: Contact initiates direct communication
- **Timeline**: Immediate action

#### C. Emergency Response
- **Action**: Reply "EMERGENCY" to email
- **Result**: Triggers additional emergency protocols
- **Timeline**: Immediate escalation

#### D. No Response
- **Action**: Contact doesn't respond within 5 minutes
- **Result**: System suggests main user call contact directly
- **Timeline**: 5-minute timeout

### 4. What the Main User Experiences

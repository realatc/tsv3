## Score Breakdown

This card shows a line-by-line breakdown of every factor that contributed to the total threat score. Each entry shows the source of the finding (e.g., `NLP`, `Sender`) and the points it added to the score.

### Scoring System

- **How it works**: Points are awarded for various risk factors. The total score determines the final threat level.
- **Maximum Score**: 13 points.
- **Thresholds**:
    - **High**: 5 or more points.
    - **Medium**: 2-4 points.
    - **Low**: 0-1 points.

By reviewing the breakdown, you can see the exact reasons behind the assessment, helping you learn to spot similar threats in the future.

## How This Helps You Make Decisions

### Quick Risk Assessment
The threat level gives you an immediate understanding of the risk:
- **High:** Stop and investigate further
- **Medium:** Proceed with caution
- **Low:** Likely safe but stay alert

### Detailed Analysis
The breakdown shows you exactly why the threat was flagged:
- **Which factors** contributed to the risk
- **How many points** each factor earned
- **What patterns** were detected

### Pattern Recognition
By reviewing multiple threats, you can identify:
- **Common scam tactics** targeting you
- **Senders to watch out for**
- **Types of threats** you're most vulnerable to
- **Effectiveness** of your security measures

## Understanding False Positives

### What Causes False Positives
Sometimes legitimate messages get flagged because they:
- **Contain urgent language** for legitimate reasons (e.g., work emergencies)
- **Come from new senders** (e.g., new colleagues, service providers)
- **Include links** to new but legitimate websites
- **Use similar language** to scams (e.g., "verify your account")

### How to Handle False Positives
1. **Check the breakdown** - See which factors triggered the alert
2. **Verify independently** - Contact the sender through known channels
3. **Consider context** - Is this urgent language justified?
4. **Trust your instincts** - If something feels wrong, it probably is
5. **Report if needed** - Help improve the system by reporting false positives

## Tips for Using This Tab

### For High-Risk Threats
1. **Don't panic** - The system caught the threat before it could harm you
2. **Follow recommendations** - Block, report, and delete
3. **Learn from it** - Note what patterns to watch for
4. **Share with others** - Warn friends and family about similar threats

### For Medium-Risk Threats
1. **Investigate further** - Check the breakdown for specific concerns
2. **Verify independently** - Don't rely solely on the threat assessment
3. **Be cautious** - Better safe than sorry
4. **Monitor patterns** - Watch for similar threats

### For Low-Risk Threats
1. **Stay alert** - Low risk doesn't mean no risk
2. **Trust your judgment** - If something feels wrong, investigate
3. **Report if suspicious** - Help improve the detection system
4. **Learn patterns** - Understand what makes threats low-risk

## Continuous Improvement

The system continuously improves by:
- **Analyzing new threats** as they emerge
- **Learning from user reports** of false positives and missed threats

- **Refining scoring algorithms** for better accuracy

### Your Role in Improvement
You can help improve threat detection by:
- **Reporting false positives** - When legitimate messages are flagged

# Common Digital Scams

Staying safe online means knowing what to watch out for! Here are some of the most common digital scams:

## 1. Phishing Emails
- Fake emails that look like they're from your bank, a delivery service, or even your boss.
- They ask you to click a link or provide personal info.
- **Tip:** Never click suspicious links or provide sensitive info via email.

## 2. Tech Support Scams
- A pop-up or call claims your computer is infected and you must pay for help.
- **Tip:** Real tech companies will never cold-call you for payment or remote access.

## 3. Lottery & Prize Scams
- "Congratulations! You've won a prize!" (that you never entered for)
- They ask for a fee or your bank details to claim it.
- **Tip:** If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

## 4. Romance Scams
- Someone you meet online quickly professes love and asks for money.
- **Tip:** Be cautious with online relationships and never send money to someone you haven't met in person.

## 5. Fake Shopping Sites
- Websites offering deals that are too good to be true, but never deliver the goods.
- **Tip:** Check for reviews, secure payment options, and be wary of new or unknown sites.

## 6. Impersonation Scams
- Scammers pretend to be someone you know (boss, family, friend) and ask for urgent help or money.
- **Tip:** Always verify requests for money or sensitive info, even if they seem to come from someone you trust.

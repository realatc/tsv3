**Critical risk - immediate action required**
- Confirmed malware or ransomware
- Active phishing campaigns
- Zero-day exploits
- Nation-state attacks
- Critical infrastructure threats

### ðŸŸ  **HIGH** (Orange)
**High risk - proceed with extreme caution**
- Confirmed phishing attempts
- Known scam patterns
- Requests for sensitive information (passwords, SSN, bank details)
- Suspicious payment requests
- Impersonation of official entities
- Strong indicators of malicious intent
- Urgency tactics and pressure techniques
- Suspicious URLs with technical indicators
- Unusual requests from known contacts
- Immediate action required

### ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** (Yellow)
**Medium risk - be cautious**
- Messages from unknown senders
- Contains links to external websites
- Requests for personal information
- Unusual timing or frequency
- Some indicators of suspicious activity
- Newly registered domains
- SSL certificate issues

### ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** (Green)
**Low risk - safe**
- Messages from known, trusted contacts
- No suspicious patterns detected
- Safe content and links
- Normal communication patterns
- Valid SSL certificates
- Established domain reputation

### âšª **NONE** (White)
**No risk detected**
- Clean, legitimate content
- Verified safe sources
- No suspicious indicators

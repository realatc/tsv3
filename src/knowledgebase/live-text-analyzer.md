# Live Text Analyzer: How It Works

## Overview

The Live Text Analyzer is a powerful AI-powered tool that scans text content in real-time to identify potential security threats, scams, and malicious content. It provides instant threat assessments with actionable recommendations to help you stay safe online.

## How It Works

### 1. Text Input Processing
When you paste text into the analyzer:
- The system processes your input through advanced natural language processing
- It analyzes the content for suspicious patterns, keywords, and contextual clues
- Multiple threat detection algorithms work simultaneously to assess risk

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis
The analyzer uses **Perplexity AI** with the `llama-3.1-sonar-small-128k-online` model to:
- Evaluate text for phishing attempts, scams, and malicious content
- Identify social engineering tactics and urgency indicators
- Detect suspicious URLs, phone numbers, and contact information
- Analyze language patterns associated with fraud and deception

### 3. Threat Intelligence Integration
The system leverages real-time threat intelligence from:
- **Perplexity AI's Knowledge Base**: Access to current threat data and scam patterns
- **Cybersecurity Databases**: Information about known malicious entities
- **Real-time Web Search**: Latest information about emerging threats
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI models trained on millions of scam examples

## Threat Level Grading System

The analyzer uses a 5-tier threat assessment system:

### ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL** (Red)
**Immediate action required**
- Confirmed phishing attempts
- Known scam patterns
- Requests for sensitive information (passwords, SSN, bank details)
- Suspicious payment requests
- Impersonation of official entities

### ðŸŸ  **HIGH** (Orange)
**High risk - proceed with extreme caution**
- Strong indicators of malicious intent
- Urgency tactics and pressure techniques
- Suspicious URLs or attachments
- Unusual requests from known contacts
- Offers that seem too good to be true

### ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** (Yellow)
**Moderate risk - exercise caution**
- Some suspicious elements present
- Unusual language or formatting
- Requests for personal information
- Links to unfamiliar websites
- Unusual timing or context

### ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** (Green)
**Minimal risk - standard precautions**
- No obvious threats detected
- Standard communication patterns
- Familiar senders and contexts
- No suspicious requests or links

### âšª **NONE** (White)
**No threats detected**
- Clean, legitimate content
- Normal communication patterns
- No suspicious elements identified

## What the Analyzer Looks For

### Red Flags & Indicators
- **Urgency Tactics**: "Act now," "Limited time," "Immediate action required"
- **Authority Impersonation**: Claims to be from banks, government agencies, tech support
- **Sensitive Data Requests**: Passwords, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers
- **Suspicious URLs**: Slightly misspelled domains, unusual TLDs, redirect chains
- **Unusual Language**: Grammatical errors, inconsistent formatting, foreign language mixed in
- **Too-Good-to-Be-True Offers**: Free money, prizes, unexpected refunds
- **Pressure Tactics**: Threats, deadlines, emotional manipulation

### Technical Analysis
- **URL Analysis**: Checks against known malicious domains and phishing databases
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common scam templates and social engineering techniques
- **Context Analysis**: Evaluates the relationship between sender and recipient
- **Temporal Analysis**: Considers timing and frequency of communications
- **Cross-Reference**: Compares against known threat intelligence databases

## Data Sources & Intelligence

### Real-Time Threat Intelligence
The analyzer connects to multiple data sources:
- **Perplexity AI Knowledge Base**: Current threat information and scam patterns
- **Google Safe Browsing API**: Real-time URL safety checking
- **Cybersecurity Feeds**: Latest threat intelligence from security researchers
- **Community Reports**: User-submitted scam reports and patterns
- **AI Training Data**: Millions of examples of legitimate vs. malicious content

### Continuous Learning
The system continuously improves through:
- **Machine Learning**: Adapts to new threat patterns and techniques
- **User Feedback**: Learns from user reports and corrections
- **Threat Evolution**: Updates to counter new scam tactics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies emerging threat trends

## Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- **No Data Storage**: Your text is not stored or saved after analysis
- **Secure Processing**: All analysis happens through encrypted API connections
- **Privacy First**: No personal information is collected or shared
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive content is processed securely without logging

### API Security
- **Encrypted Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS encryption
- **Secure Authentication**: API keys are protected and rotated regularly
